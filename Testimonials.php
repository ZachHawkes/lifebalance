                I was very skeptical of working with you at first because of my lack of understanding of energy healing.  After the first session I was shocked at the accuracy of my current emotions that were identified.  I was much more open after that and on the path of self discovery.  Working with you I learned a lot about myself that had been hidden from view, things that I didn’t even know about myself.  After bringing those to light I was able to work through them.  The results of that have been very rewarding, my confidence is much higher. My faith has increased immensely, my physical ailments have been reduced and some were totally eliminated. I feel like I am in control of my life and that I can make the necessary adjustments to get the results I want in my life.  Thanks for your help! I am very appreciative of your sincerity in caring about me and helping me find the answers to my questions.  – Dan F.

                When I went in for my appointment I was a little skeptical, but I was willing to try anything to help me change the way I was feeling! While at my appointment and having my negative emotions released I felt light almost like a bunch of weight had been lifted off my shoulders and I didn't feel cold anymore! Since I had my session done I can't explain the joy and happiness that has come back into our house! I feel as if we are a family again and that we can conquer anything together! I highly recommend Julie!  - Amanda P.

                Julie is so great at recognizing areas I need to adjust in my life and releasing negative trapped emotions that have held me back.  She is guided spiritually and has the intuition to shine light on the area of my life needing change.  I would highly recommend you work with her.  She is simply fantastic.

                Working with Julie doing energy work has been life changing.  First, she is very empathetic, nonjudgmental and keeps information private.  These characteristics offer comfort and ease to be able to be open.  Her work has helped me understand core issues and underlying emotions that have been holding me back from living the life I’d like.  Her assistance with offering suggestions to work through these issues has allowed me to improve my life and relationships.  I’m so grateful to be able to work with Julie.  She has been a life changer and is a valuable person in my life.  Kaydee M.

                "I was in a slump, a rut, a pit, you might say. I was discouraged  with my everyday life. Julie did energy work with me. My feelings of being stagnant dissipated. I feel lighter, not weighed down. I have been able to set new goals & move forward with my life. I love the energy work Julie does. She has helped me immensely.  Thanks Julie. ".    Carol F.

                I heard about Julie from a friend that she had helped. I was pretty skeptical but she was doing a free session so I thought it couldn’t hurt to try. I was amazed about how in tune she was with how I was feeling. The first session she did a lot of work and it physically wore me out. I went right to bed after we were done.  I could tell that something had changed. I have dealt with depression for over a year and she could see that. I am happier and more focused now and still work with Julie. You are doing yourself a disservice if you don’t give this a try.     R.D.

                I was having terrible nightmares for weeks and I felt so anxious and stressed.  Once she did energy work on me she was able to dig up what was really going on.  As she was telling me my deeper anxieties, each one of them resonated with me and I realized this is what had been going on!  She gave me some homework and afterwards I felt so much better about everything and now I sleep wonderfully without any nightmares!  I love energy work with her!   Alicia M.

                I have been feeling down and out of sorts lately.  I talked to Julie about my feelings, she is my friend.  She told me about this energy healing she does.  I was willing to try anything to get me out of this funk.  I made an appointment with her and felt like I made the right decision.  When I met with her, the spirit was very strong inside of me.  I started to release my emotions right away.  As she done the process I hadn't cried that hard in such a long time, it was like everything that was built up in me was just running out through my eyes.  I she did her thing, I could see answers to questions in my mind before she even asked them.  I felt so strong about what we were doing that I knew it was exactly what I needed.  When I left her house, I felt so centered and I knew what I needed to do to help myself.  I knew that my Father in Heaven was watching over me always.  I struggle within my own self, I am my worst enemy, but I now have something to work on to improve myself.  Julie is so in tune with the Spirit, and I could totally feel him through her.  She is amazing. And I can only recommend her work to everyone I know. I look forward to meeting with her again to see the progress I have made.  My whole being just feels so much more centered.

            Working with Julie Hawkes is a wonderful rewarding experience.  She made me feel at ease on our first session.  She is so understanding and non-judgmental.  I feel I can tell her my deep darkest secrets while processing my issues to becoming healthier in my relationships with my family and friends.  Thanks, Julie for taking your time to be my friend!

            I love my energy sessions with Julie and I can’t believe how quickly I feel a difference.  As long as I can remember I have struggled with anxiety.  A few months ago I was waking up in the middle of the night with terrible stress and anxiety.  I couldn’t go back to sleep for hours.  After only a couple of sessions I found myself peacefully sleeping through the night! I have been blessed to have many experiences where Julie has helped me and I have felt immediate relief.  Once at work I had a twitch in my eye.  Julie was able to work on me and within a couple of minutes it was totally gone!  Julie has a great gift and my life has been blessed by my sessions with her.

            For the last few years my son has really struggled with reading.  Every night when it was time for him to read he would get emotionally upset.  After only one energy session with Julie my son’s attitude about reading has totally changed.  He now comes home from school and I don’t even have to ask him to read.  The work Julie does is totally amazing!  K.H.
